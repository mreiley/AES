# AES
### AES Encryption And Test Vectors

Description: Implement AES, the Advanced Encryption Standard. AES is one of the most popular and
secure encryption standards, and was adopted by the US government in 2002 and Test Vectors method.

### Task


 * Test vectors are sets of known inputs and keys that generate known encrypted results (ciphers).
Inputs, keys and outputs are not necessarily text characters. NIST distributes the reference of
AES test vectors as AES Known Answer Test (KAT) Vectors.

* Inputs, keys and outputs are not necessarily text characters. Accordingly,
the test vectors are all presented,here as double-byte characters,
in other words as 16 bits per character.

* To use the packages:crypto/aes,reflect
